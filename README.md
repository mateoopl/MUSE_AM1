# WELCOME!
## This repository includes all the exercises and coding made duringthe lessons of AM1, on the fist year of Master's Degree on Space Systems (MUSE-IDR). The milestones proposed on this course are:
### MILESTONE 1: Prototypes to integrate orbits without functions. 
### MILESTONE 2: Prototypes to integrate orbits with functions.
### MILESTONE 3 : Error estimation of numerical solutions.
### MILESTONE 4 : Linear problems. Regions of absolute stability.
### MILESTONE 5 : N body problem.
### MILESTONE 6 : Lagrange points and their stability.

## For the correct working of these codes some aditional .py documents have been created, which includes all the functions used for Numerical Integration, Error Calculations and aditional Mathematical calculations needed:
### Numerical_Schemes.py
### Stability.py
### Simple_Math.py

## Aditionally, the following Python packages are used: Numpy, Matplotlib, math.
